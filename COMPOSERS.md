### There are just a handful of my favorite composers. If I were to put all of them it would take a very long time.  Even the composer I have selected sound vastly distinct from each other, but all have aspects of their music and unique *sound* that I would love to learn more about.  I enjoy their music and the **theory** present behind some of their works.  For instance, Jacob Collier makes use of [negative harmony](https://musicalinstrumentpro.com/negative-harmony/) and Hans Zimmer often implements elements from the [Minimalism Era](https://hellomusictheory.com/learn/minimalism/).
