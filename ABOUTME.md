# About Me

## Early Life
### I am currently a student at the [University of Missouri-Columbia](https://missouri.edu/about), where I pursue a degree in Information Technology.  I attended [De Smet Jesuit High School](https://www.desmet.org/about) and [Saint Monica Catholic School](https://stmonicastl.org/school/) for elementary and middle school.

### In school I have always gravitated more towards math and science, often times disregarding the other subjects.  I have always had an interest in computers and built my own system in 8th grade after saving up money for just over 18 months.  I have gone on to help build about 6-7 systems for friends and family.  Due to this interest, I always figured I would end up in a technology field.

### During my time in high school when quarantine hit, I picked up a new hobby.  This hobby just happened to be **music composition**.  I instantly fell in love with it and spent many hours learning the basics.  After wrapping my head around the fundamentals of **music theory** I began noticing some interesting patterns that I couldn't seem to find in any resources.  These patterns have lead me on what has felt like a *wild goose chase* for multiple years now.  **My goal is to combine my passion for technology with my passion for music and see what I comes from it.**

## Present Day
### When not working on school related work, I spend most of my time hanging out with my [friends](./MYFRIENDS.md), working on my [Theory of Systematic Relativity](./THEORY.md), playing [my favorite video games](./VIDEOGAMES.md), and listening to [my favorite composers](./COMPOSERS.md).
### I am also the composer and sound designer for a new game that my friends and I just started developing.  It is very much in the works and maleable to change, but at the time of writing this it is a story-based [rogue-lite](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rogue-lite) game that focues on simple and engaging combat elements, a varied cast of characters that each have stories that change and develop as you progress, and a *retro-inspired* pixel artstyle.

## Coding Projects
### I am quite a novice and inexperienced programmer at the time of writing this.  For instance, it was only about two months ago when I first wrote the *Hello World* program.

```
print('Hello World!')
```
