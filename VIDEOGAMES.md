# My Top 5 Video Games of All Time!
## 1. Pok√©mon HeartGold/SoulSilver
![HeartGold and SoulSilver](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.YdfwWN-eh63JwPiUVb2UJgHaE8%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=e57a43e27774929d5ebe4ddf323042322a9bbf0a3b7b631ff9e48a9cba25f608&ipo=images)
### This game is just about all I played from first grade to 4th grade.  It is very nostalgic for me and I've probably beaten it over 50 times.  I actually still have my original copy and save file, which has over 500 hours on it.  I probably have over 2000 hours logged across the entire franchise.
## 2. MarioKart 8 Deluxe

### I have always loved playing MarioKart as a kid.  This was the first game I got for my switch and it was honestly all I played for the couple years I had the device.  I once was in the running for a world record in the Time Trials mode.
## 3. Terraria
![Terraria](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.4JevTKHwRQ22tuPPk_Ig_wHaDt%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=1c6646ecd0c548add53c91f76674be815cf0408d29dc616f26ff8f849e9263bd&ipo=images)
### This is another game I have logged hundreds of hours into.  I own this game on like four different platforms. I really enjoy playing the modded version and overcoming the newly added difficulty.  The game has a fantastic progression system that makes it flow really well.
## 4. Minecraft
![Minecraft](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse2.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.Kl4g0wFFRbALIh5ZS1buDgHaEK%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=1a8f757cb219d13dd1d6a1a68d46009a525a15d7f73d69faa3d01748029a4118&ipo=images)
### I played this game a bunch as a kid and still play it friends from time to time.  I find the game really relaxing and enjoy the survival aspects of it.  I also own this game on so many different platforms.
## 5.  Overwatch
![Overwatch](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse4.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.JiC6aDVaXvr3ZTgsuwicYgHaFS%26pid%3DApi&f=1&ipt=3235ca1fdc96d0319ff7ded7ae65adf0ce02490c9194ec24abd617b77c65b4e8&ipo=images)
### I have over 1000 hours in this game.  I enjoy playing it with friends and don't play competitive anymore.  I peaked in Masters as a support player and mained Zenyatta.
